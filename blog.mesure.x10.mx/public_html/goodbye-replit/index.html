    <h1>Goodbye, Replit</h1>
    <p>On January 1, 2024, Replit will be going paid by not allowing anyone to host things for free, which is part of the reason I used to use Replit so much. I just want a place where I can make random projects in the web and host them for free. I have started to use <a href="https://x10hosting.com" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">x10hosting</a> instead of Replit. The reason I switched is not because I don't have the budget for Replit, but because there are cheaper and better options.</p>

    <h2>Replit's Pricing</h2>
    <p>Replit is actually a good IDE, one of the best ones that I've used, but their pricing is too much for me, and I really don't feel like spending money on an IDE when I can FTP into x10hosting from VSCode.</p>
    <p>I might have been willing to pay for hosting on Replit if it was a bit cheaper, or maybe available using Cycles, but it isn't. I do have enough money to pay for hosting on Replit, but I feel like its always had an inevitable downfall, because hosting over ten thousand websites is just not sustainable, and I completely get that. I would rather Replit be paid for hosting then have free hosting but very few features available.</p>
    <h2>Why I made this decision</h2>
    <p>Ever since I joined Replit back in 2021, it started getting worse and worse over time. My experince when I initially joined was amazing. If Replit still worked how it did back then, I would give it 5/5 stars and recommend it as my favorite IDE. But now that I can't easily make projects on Replit and have them hosted for free, I have decided to stop using Replit.</p>
    <p>I have used Replit more than any other IDE, and even (somehow) made friends on it. I have also seen some pretty cool projects, such as <a href="https://spiralgraph.sharkcoding.repl.co/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">SharkCoding's Spiral Graph</a> and <a href="https://drawing-with-orbits.pygrammer5.repl.co/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">PyGrammer5's Drawing with Orbits</a>. I have even made some projects of my own that I am proud of, like <a href="https://color-blender.mesure73loafs.repl.co" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">my Color Blender</a>. [Update 11·09·2023 15:23 UTC: Now hosted on <a href="https://projects.mesure.x10.mx/color-blender" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">my projects page</a>]</p>
    <p>Even though Replit was my most used IDE, I am still pretty good at Visual Studio Code and could easily get used to another IDE if I need to. This was not an overnight decision. I have been thinking about this for multiple weeks, and ultimately decided to abandon my Replit account.</p>
    <h2>What's happenning to my Replit account?</h2>
    <p>I will not be deleting my Replit account, but I will only log on if I need to get code from one of my projects or if I get a link from another person to a Replit page.</p>
    <p>None of my projects will be hosted on Replit. I am planning to transfer my best projects onto this website, but I can't promise anything yet. If you want to see something, you can copy the code from any of my projects and open the file yourself.</p>
    <h2>What should you do?</h2>
    <p>What you do is completely up to you. This was my decision that has been made over multiple weeks. If you are looking for a place to host things for free, do some research and find something that you like. If you don't care about hosting and just want an IDE, then you can keep using Replit. Your choice is, of course, your choice.</p>
    <h2>Goodbye, Replit</h2>
    <p>Goodbye, Replit. You treated me well, and I understand that you need to go paid to actually be sustainable, but like pretty much everything, users will come and go, including me. To anyone who found me on Replit and has been following me: Thank you. I couldn't ask for a better time on Replit.</p>
    <p>Goodbye.</p>
