    <h1>My response to Gen Alpha</h1>
    <p>Recently, a lot of people have been saying that we're screwed for the future because of how kids in Generation Alpha (also Gen Alpha or Gen A) have been acting. Over the past few weeks, I went down a rabbit hole, watching a bunch of YouTube videos, reading online comments, and even talking to people. I have seen a lot of good videos with really good points in them that I would recommend watching if you have a bit of time.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>I do not have any experience with parenting. Do not take any of this as advice on how to parent. This is just my thoughts on the newer generation from the videos I've seen online and the multiple conversations I've had with my friends and family. Don't only read this for your opinion. Try to watch the videos I linked and maybe even find your own.</p>
    <p>Please do not send hate to any person or group of people mentioned here. This is just my opinions on the subject. I have put multiple videos and comments on this page.</p>
    <h2>My Generation and Early Childhood</h2>
    <p>Before I start talking about other generations, I want to give a bit of information on my generation. I am in Gen Z, in the later years of the generation. I remember a long time ago, like 9-10 years ago, I would watch cartoons for kids, and only play educational games using my parents' phones, and even that was monitored to a certain extent, and there were definitely limits on that. Around 5 years later, I was old enough to start having less monitored screen time, but I still had very strict time limits. I hated this rule, but now I'm glad it was put in place.</p>
    <p>For example, if I was on an airplane and needed something to do, I would ask my parents if I could play one of the educational games they downloaded on their phones. These educational games were designed to appeal to children while also being a helpful tool for learning. One of the games was a math game, and your goal was to launch rockets by completing math problems. I remember being genuinely excited to play this game, and even though I don't think it did anything, it did.</p>
    <h2>iPad Kids</h2>
    <p>Some parents who have to do work give their children iPads instead of toys, and don't add any restrictions to them. This makes them get used to always having an iPad, so when they don't have one they scream really loudly to get their way. This type of behavior is disruptive to people near them.</p>

    <p>The problem with this is that kids have full access to the internet. This allows them to see things that their brains are not developmentally ready for yet. Watching educational videos or cartoons on an iPad is fine, but why do that when you can rot your brain with Skibidi Toilet instead.</p>
    <p>This type of parenting is really bad. Yes, kids scream and yell to get their way, and if you are letting them get their way every single time, they get used to being able to just yell to get anything. Kids being upset is part of parenting. As a parent, you have responsibilities, and giving children iPads whenever they want is not part of those responsibilities. If you are giving your kids an iPad at 2 years old, you aren't ready for parenting.</p>
    <p>Setting boundaries is important. It teaches everyone, not just kids, that they can't just do whatever they want whenever they want. As a teen, I understand that there is a time and place for everything, and I was taught that yelling in a restaurant is not acceptable. If a child has no boundaries at all, they will get used to doing whatever they want in every situation, which is not what they should be taught. They should be taught about what to do at different times and places.</p>

    <h2>The Pandemic</h2>
    <p>The pandemic also didn't help with this. Some kids went through their primary stages of development during the pandemic, when everything was online. This obviously didn't help their minds, because they got used to doing everything on a screen.</p>
    <p>The pandemic also hurted their social abilities, because they couldn't go and see their friends in 3D, which made all of us less social, especially those who didn't have access to things like Discord.</p>

    <h2>Genuinely Gen Alpha</h2>
    <p>A lot of people hate on Gen Alpha in general, because most of their representation is iPad kids and selfish assholes. This is not a good representation of Gen Alpha. I understand hating on those types of kids, but there are some genuinely good people in Gen Alpha. Making a generalization from how social media portrays Gen Alpha is not fair to the kids who don't act like this.</p>

    <p>There is a chance these kids learn how to behave later on in their lives and prove all of the doubters wrong. I am hoping this happens, because if these kids don't learn anything, there will be problems in the future, not just with them but also with their kids. Their developmental process is definitely going slower, but they will eventually develop and might even surprise us.</p>

    <h2>Every Generation is Like This</h2>
    <p>People always thought of the generation after them to be worse, because the things they had as a kid isn't what the newer generation is getting. Televisions are a perfect example of this. When everyone started getting a television in their house, the generations who didn't grow up with one got worried.</p>

    <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
    <p>Physical activity and going outside is not just good for your body, but also for your mind. Even if you are just inside, kids act more natural when they aren't on an iPad all the time.</p>

    <h2>How I Would Raise Children Instead</h2>
    <p>Instead of throwing children in front of a screen early on, I would buy them toys and also encourage outside activity. The only screen time is after 3 years old, and it would be on my phone and educational things only. I would give them a phone at 13 years old, and before that they can have a laptop for talking to friends and other hobbies.</p>
    <p>If giving electronics is my only choice, I would have a system that blocks everything and makes them do a challenge for 30-60 minutes of mildly restricted screen time. That way, they are having to do challenges if they want to be on their iPad. One of my favorite things to do is coding, because it is a logical challenge and gets my brain working.</p>
    <h2>My Thoughts on Gen Alpha</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, we just need to give them some time. The more problematic kids are typically the newer ones, and since the oldest Gen Alpha kids are only 13, we need to give them some time. We can't just make our conclusions when the kids are still in their childhood. I think Gen Alpha might have success.</p>
    <p>The first step has to be from the parents. Good parenting is making your kids have good habits from the start of their lives, like going outside and talking to friends, not being on an iPad 24/7. The fact that some parents don't discipline their kids at all makes me worried. Consequences are the best way to teach kids to not do certain things, and even adults have natural consequences.</p>
