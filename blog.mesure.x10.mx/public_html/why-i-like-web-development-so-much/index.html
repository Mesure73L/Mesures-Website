    <h1>Why I like web development so much</h1>
    <p>If you did not know, I made this website and everything on it myself. Yes, I did take some stuff from the internet, but everything you see was configured by me, especially the design. I enjoy web development a lot because it has so much creative freedom involved with it, and there is no correct or incorrect way to do it.</p>
    <h2>What is web development?</h2>
    <p>Web development is making websites using HTML, JS, and CSS. There are also other things, like PHP and mySQL, for databases, and ReactJS, Vue, or jQuery to make it easier. My website only uses HTML, JS, and CSS, mostly because I am too lazy to add a framework. (Also because I hate you, Minystreem/ElectricTurtle /j)</p>
    </p>Essentially, web development is just developing a website, even if it isn't hosted or just on a local file (e.x. <code>file://(file path)</code> on most web browsers).</p>
    <h2>Why I think web development is fun</h2>
    <p>I think web development is fun because there is a lot of creative freedom, and I can basically do whatever I want. Every new website that I make, I learn something new about web development. This website (probably the main one I am going to use for at least a few years) has taught me a lot about making websites, including new things in CSS that I previously did not know.</p>
    <p>Web development for me is mostly just a learning opportunity - I can make whatever I want without limitations, and if I can't figure something out, W3Schools and Stack Overflow can help with whatever problem I'm having.</p>
    <h2>Fun Challenges</h2>
    <p>I don't just make my website for information about me. I also have a <a href="https://projects.mesure.x10.mx" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">projects page</a> where I host random projects that I made for fun. Some of them are fun challenges that I gave for myself to have a logical puzzle, like the <a href="https://projects.mesure.x10.mx/color-blender" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">color blender</a> I made.</p>
    <p>Web development is definitely one of my hobbies. It allows me to have creative freedom with a useful project, and also gives me something to do when I have free time in school.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I like web development because it is a fun and very creative challenge. It also has many different uses, all which I like.</p>
